Originally completed for AERSP 313 on 9/26/2022, this repository serves to archive this project for myself and my colleagues who worked on this.

Numeric analysis in MATLAB of equations of motion a dampened spring utilizing ODE45 as well as Runge-Kutta 2 function inside the code. 
Compared both results to the analytical solution for the problem.

C++ Folder contains similar code written in C++ which generates a .csv file for the data. MATLAB script is more functional.
